# Nutribyte Nutrition Tracker
JavaFX Desktop Application

With increasing health awareness, the global health and wellness market has been propelled with vendors promoting the healthy ingredients used in their packaged products. The app is designed following MVC design pattern and helps the consumers of these products to log and track the nutrition and ingredients they consume through these products. It uses the data provided by the US government (https://www.usda.gov/). The relevant files have been downloaded from https://www.ars.usda.gov/northeast-area/beltsville-md-bhnrc/beltsville-human-nutrition-research-center/nutrient-data-laboratory/docs/usda-branded-food-products-database/ 
These files have data about the ingredients and the nutrients in 239,000+ products sold in the US market.

Core functionalities involve use of Collections (maps, lists), enums, inner classes, polymorphism, java beans, bindings, event handlers & change listeners, exception handling, file I/O, etc.
